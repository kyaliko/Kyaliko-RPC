This program allows users to customize their Rich Presence on Discord. It has a sleek dark design with alot of features.

This program includes the Discord Dev Portal built in so you don't have to continually open your browser to change client ID's.
**The Dev Portal button can be found on the top left of the program. To close it, press the purple control-box at the top right of the program.**
